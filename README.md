## 👤 Author Implementation Notes

I chose this approach to clearly separate the responsibilities of each component and page.

I used **Tailwind CSS** because I have experience with it, and it significantly speeds up app development.

I added controls to prevent the same joke from being added more than once (in case the API returns it again), and included **toast notifications** to improve the user experience.

Additionally, I assigned **IDs to the jokes in the favorites list** to have better control and management over them.

This project uses **PNPM** as the package manager for its speed and performance benefits.
